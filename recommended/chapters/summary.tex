\chapter{Summary}

In this thesis I provide a detailed introduction of building feed-forward neural networks, supported by both talkative examples and mathematical proofs. 
The examples are based on biological motivations, and practical applications of NN. 
In the \textbf{Design and Implementation} chapter I present a guide to understand and write the neural network framework step-by-step, which I used to produce results in Case Studies chapter. 
The newest implementation can be find at \cite{DV}, supported with out-of-the-box demo scripts, and \texttt{ipython notebooks}.
The library is modular in the first place, and easy to utilize because of the layer manager functions of the \texttt{network} class found in the\url{network_module}. 
Also it is easy to \emph{fork} the implementation, and join the further development of the framework -- The phases of improvement are well documented, thanks to the version control supported by Git, and synchronized on the GitHub repository.

By working on this project I have understood the main concepts
