Every time we are interacting with our environment, we get closer to understanding it. %still the closer we are the less we understand. 
However, as a byproduct, further questions arise, for which pure logical (mathematical?) solution is not available, or the problem is larger what we can solve.
Luckily we can always turn back to nature for inspiration: biological systems have proven their efficiency, therefore their functions are worth to be further analyzed -- even if there could be theoretically a better way to tackle obstacles. 
One of the many branches of artificial intelligence, Neural Networks are based on the nervous systems of living organisms which is capable of self-learning.

Such a simple paradigm is playing a fundamental role in boosting 
industry and research of today, because introducing Machine Learning to many fields of life seems to results in great leap forward. 
Thanks to the recent technological advancements, even with the current computational capacity of a personal computer one can get encouraging results by simply exploring the core principles of the topic.

\paragraph{Main motivation.} By using external libraries \cite{TF, torch, caffe}, without diving deep into mathematical proofs, and treating neural networks as black-boxes, thousands of useful applications \cite{haykin2004comprehensive} are made. 
On the other hand, building such architectures from the very basics helps to clarify how simple units might be organized, taught \cite{werbos1994roots}, and function \cite{hornik1989multilayer} as a large system. 
As complexity arises, the processes in the network becomes unclear and brings the question: what is the purpose of each node? 
Methods to visualize how activation patterns formulate, and what information is held within them has been already investigated \cite{yosinski2015understanding}, and applied to improve performance \cite{zeiler2014visualizing}. 
My studies mainly rely on recent publications, and research in field of computer vision. The design of my own Deep Learning framework library is influenced by off-the-press tutorials \cite{Goodfellow-et-al-2016-Book, deeplearningdotnet, nnsdl, stanfordlectures, gibiansky} and open-source libraries \cite{TF, torch, caffe} available to anyone. 

\paragraph{Primary goal.} With my work I intend to bring closer, and demystify cutting-edge concepts of applied neural networkings for larger audiences. 
On related works and case studies I want to show what can be done by simply going back to the drawing board
