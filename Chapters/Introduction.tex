\chapter*{Abstract}

Machine learning is the main core of recent technological improvements. Practically by introducing \emph{Artificial Intelligence} in any field of industry or research the problem of processing big data gets solved. Technological leap-forwards usually occurs when main concepts of efficient functioning biological systems are adopted to solve intuitive, still algorithmically complex tasks. A special field of research in computer science relies on Neural Networks, the abstraction of nervous system found in living organisms. Powerful architecture called \emph{Deep Neural Networks} is in focus of many studies. Generally it is constructed by organizing perceptrons into lattices, and connecting succeeding layers together, and trained by simply feeding previously recorded data either in a supervised or unsupervised manner. Results shows that networks perform much better on tasks that would require specialists to give a general solution. When developing further algorithms to improve efficiency of the training (also to reduce the number of training samples, and the time required for convergence), it is helpful to know what happens inside the black box through methods .
